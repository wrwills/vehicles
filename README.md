# Vehicle lookup

Adapted from https://github.com/playframework/playframework/tree/master/templates/play-scala-intro

I initially tried to make this work using the play-slick-codegen-flyway-seed template, but couldn't get that to work.  The table definitions in VehicleRepository were generated using slick codegen.
